# django-rstrnt
 A restaurant project made using django

##
Honk once again. I know, it's been a while since I worked on a proper project (I mean, I _was_ working on the MASK website, but it's not on my own profile, so you can go visit it if you want by clicking [here]("https://github.com/mask-tech/MASK").) This one is another project done in an effort to learn something new.

### What's new?
Glad you asked (I mean, it's a monologue, but still, go with it.) After working for months with nodeJS, express, nunjucks, mongoDB, I am learning... Python? Yes. This project is a Django project in Python. Django (from what I gather) is a framework. Essentially, all I do is the same as what I did with node, express, nunjucks, etc., but all of them are already in one place rather than me installing everything all as per their requirements. I guess it is worth defecting back to Python (_sigh_ I was just getting the hang of JS.)

### Why `py` when you're already doing `js`?
To answer the question, it's pretty simple. This one is more of a project to learn the basics of django and things related to it, before we start working on the website of the hall. 

This one will be active for only a few days. So excuse me if it feels a bit sloppy ;-;

Until later

Honk
